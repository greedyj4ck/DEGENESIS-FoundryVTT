  "DGNS.AreaDamageDescription": "The weapon doesn’t aim directly at an enemy: it covers an area stated in degrees. Everything inside this area can take Damage.",
  "DGNS.ArmorpiercingDescription": "The projectile used is highly compact and fast. It pierces armor as if it were made of paper. Armor piercing projectiles do not necessarily cause more Damage, but they ignore the special Qualities like “Massive” or “Bulletproof” the target’s armor might have.",
  "DGNS.BiometricallyEncodedDescription": "The shaft contains biometrical sensors that are only triggered when the right person wields the weapon. Often, the electronics hum and vibrate to show their readiness. In the hands of a stranger, nothing happens: he cannot fire the weapon. To switch off this protective mechanism or change the encoding, the circuits have to be formatted or bypassed. Both require a skillful technician with an electronics workshop. He first has to make an Action roll on AGI+Crafting against the Difficulty of the Quality to lay bare the electronics. With INT+Engineering (Difficulty), he identifies the circuitry, understands its workings, and manipulates it. If one of the rolls fails, the Difficulty rises by (1). If it rises to (12), the weapon powers down. The only value it now has is its scrap value.",
  "DGNS.BluntDescription": "Judgment hammers and clubs are Blunt weapons. They are especially effective against armor with the “Massive” Quality.",
  "DGNS.WeaponCamoDescription": "A weapon with the “Camo” Quality does not necessarily look like a weapon or is easily hidden. The Quality rating equals the Difficulty to see through this camouflage with a roll on INS+Perception",
  "DGNS.CloudDescription": "When a grenade is detonated, its agent spreads andcovers an area with a radius of several meters. If there isno wind, the cloud hovers above the battlefield for a few Combat Rounds before dissipating. If someone remainsin the cloud, the Damage or other effects are cumulativeunless stated otherwise.",
  "DGNS.DazedDescription": "A weapon with this Quality does not cause Flesh Wounds, but instead directly reduces Ego Points. Unless noted differently, armor reduces the Damage.",
  "DGNS.DeviationDescription": "Grenades and other indirect weapons never exactly hit their target. Every successful attack goes along with a roll (1D). The result is the deviation of the intended target in meters. The Triggers are subtracted from the result: the more Triggers, the more exact the attack.<br>When an attack fails, you roll 2D to determine the distance in meters between the impact point of the missile and the intended target.",
  "DGNS.DoubleBarreledDescription": "The weapon has two barrels that can be fired together or independently. Whatever the attacker decides to do, he only needs one Attack roll. To shoot from both barrels doubles the Damage.",
  "DGNS.EntangledDescription": "A bola entangles the legs, a net makes movement impossible: weapons with the “Entangled” Quality bringa penalty on all Skills requiring movement in addition totheir standard Damage. The attack's Triggers are not added to the Damage, but to the penalty. The fighter can try tofree himself with his next Action: by force (BOD+Force) orby wiggling out of the entanglement (AGI+Mobility). TheDifficulty is (2). However, the penalty applies. A companioncan come to his aid and roll BOD+Force (2) as his Action totear the net or the bola away from his comrade.",
  "DGNS.ExplosiveDescription": "The ammo used detonates in a fireball and destroys everything in a certain radius. Apply the explosion rules",
  "DGNS.FatalDescription": "Thermonuclear detonations, the invisible death from a microwave ray gun, or a nanite infection ignore armor and ear or otherwise destroy the creature from the inside. A weapon with the “Fatal” Quality causes Trauma Damage.",
  "DGNS.FireHazardousDescription": "The ammo the weapon uses ignites its target. Apply the fire rules",
  "DGNS.FragileDescription": "If at least one dice rolls a 1, the weapon shatters. If the Action was successful, it at least causes Damage.",
  "DGNS.ImpactDescription": "This weapon is heavy and damn unwieldy, but in the hands of a pro, it’s a tool of destruction. The fighter may only attack again or defend in his next Action if he has at least the stated amount of Triggers. If he has fewer Triggers, he loses his balance and needs (1) Action to get a grip on the weapon again. He may, however, also drop it and fight on with bare fists or another weapon.",
  "DGNS.JammingDescription": "Jamming is a curse, and a shooter who uses a weapon with this Quality should resign to his fate. If he rolls more 1s than 6s when attacking, the weapon jams. It takes (1) Action to remove the jam",
  "DGNS.MuzzleLoaderDescription": "The weapon is loaded with black powder and then with a projectile via the barrel. This procedure is time-consuming and takes (2) Actions.",
  "DGNS.OutOfControlDescription": "Some weapons are just as dangerous for their wielder as for those he attacks. If the attacker misses his target, he has to get his weapon under control again: he rolls BOD+Melee (Difficulty). If this roll fails, too, the weapon hurts him as if it had attacked him.",
  "DGNS.PiercingDescription": "The bullet or the charge fired pierces any armor up to the Armor rating in brackets completely. Any Armor rating above the number in brackets is subtracted from the Damage as usual or—depending on the weapon—the bullet is completely deflected.",
  "DGNS.SalvoesDescription": "Some automatic weapons have a high rate of fire. This gives them the “Salvoes” Quality. The shooter can fire several bullets in rapid succession—and thus in (1) Action. The maximum number of bullets fired is listed in the brackets. Every bullet increases the Handling by +1D and the Damage by (1). If several targets are close together and the shooter wants to move the weapon, he splits his attack dice evenly between targets, rounded down.<br>He rolls for every target and determines the Damage; the extra Damage is also divided between the targets. If he fires a salvo of 5 bullets against 3 targets, the extra Damage of (5) decreases to (1) point of Damage per target (5 divided by 3 is 1, rounded down). Of course, a salvo cannot hit more targets than it contained bullets.",
  "DGNS.ScatterDescription": "The weapon fires dozens of projectiles that spread out in a cone and hit the target. Shotguns, for example, are scatter weapons. While buckshot ammo punches giant holes into the targets at close range, its destructive force dissipates quickly after only a few meters. The Damage stated in the weapon stats therefore is only true for close range. For greater ranges, the Damage decreases by (4). On the other hand, there is no Distance penalty",
  "DGNS.SensitiveDescription": "High-precision weapons like sniper rifles are sensitive to jolting. When a fighter with such a weapon is forced into melee or is attacked, 1T is enough for the opponent to Damage the weapon: its Handling permanently decreases by -1D.<br>Skilled craftsmen can repair a damaged weapon. They roll AGI+Crafting: the Tech Level of the weapon and the Damage taken determine the Difficulty. If the roll succeeds, the Damage is repaired. If it fails, the Handling decreases by another -1D.",
  "DGNS.SmoothRunningDescription": "The perfect weapon for attacks in rapid succession. If the fighter reaches at least the stated number of Triggers with his Attack roll, he may attack again right afterwards, though this time with a penalty of -2D.<br>Smooth Running can be activated on these extra attacks, but the penalty rises by -2D with every additional attack.",
  "DGNS.SpecialDescription": "This weapon has a special Quality or trait that is too complicated to explain in a short table. Look for its entry in 'Cult Equipment,' from page 125 onwards.",
  "DGNS.SpecialDamageDescription": "A weapon with “Special Damage” is designed to cause extra Damage when used against a certain class of enemies.",
  "DGNS.StandardDescription": "You fight for a common cause, carry it out onto the battlefield, are brothers and sisters in spirit—and the standard inspires and unites you all. As long as it is raised, everyone around it adds its bonus as dice to their Attack rolls.",
  "DGNS.TalismanDescription": "This item has a sentimental value that cannot be measured in Armor rating or piercing force: it gives its wearer extra dice on PSY+Faith/Willpower.",
  "DGNS.WeaponTerrifyingDescription": "Lights flare, and a voice synthesizer announces readiness in a foreign tongue. Bizarre shapes, devastating Damage, glowing tubes, or thumping pistons: some weapons signal their appetite for destruction to the wasteland dweller, others seem weirdly ensouled, as though a grim god had created them for Judgment Day.<br>The very sight of them is enough to strike fear in the heart of the enemy: all opponents must successfully roll PSY+Faith/Willpower against the Difficulty of the Quality or suffer a penalty of -2D to their next Action. At the beginning of every Combat Round, they can gather their wits with a successful Action roll and get rid of the penalty. Those who manage this roll once are immune for the rest of the combat.",
  "DGNS.ThunderStrikeDescription": "Every shot is a thunder strike that makes the dust dance and shakes the snow from the trees. A thunder strike makes mammoth herds stampede, and other animals might flee. Activating this weapon ruins any chance of stealth, and everyone will be aware of where the user is.",
  "DGNS.ExtendedReloadDescription ": "Many weapons have extensive loading processes that cannot be typically completed during combat. The time required to reload the weapon is listed next to the Quality.",
  "DGNS.GruesomeDescription": "Bristling with jagged edges or menacing spikes, this weapon is designed to continue hurting long after it impacts the target. A weapon with this Quality adds (1) bonus Trigger per rating when causing Complications, if at least one Trigger has been spent on a Complication",
  "DGNS.StunDescription": "Lightning arcs across the tip of the Shocker as it presses against a target’s side, a Judgement hammer crashes into the skull of a savage Clanner, a thunderclap roars as the shrapnel of an armor piercing bullet knocks a Neolibyan, who thought himself safe inside his Surge Tank, off his feet. Weapons with the Stun Quality shake the targets and make their thoughts rattle around inside their head, delaying any of their reactions. The target is inflicted with the Disorientation Complication, at a rating equal to that of the Quality.",
  "DGNS.PanicDescription": "The weapon is more than simply terrifying, it shakes all who witness its effects and power to the core. Even a glimpse of it in operation is enough to bring all but the most steadfast and resolute of warriors back to the state of a whimpering savage gazing up in awe at the power of the Gods. Anyone who sees a weapon with this Quality wreaking havoc must roll a Mental Defense with a Difficulty equal to the rating of the Quality. If they fail, they are affected by the Shellshock Complication.",
  "DGNS.SingleLoaderDescription": "This weapon is not reloaded via a detachable magazine, stripper clip, or speed loader, instead it may have a loading gate or use a magazine tube and requires loading one round at a time.<br>The number of shots that can be loaded in a single Action is specified by the rating of the Single Loader Quality",
  "DGNS.PoisonedDescription": "The agent attacks the metabolism. If the victim successfully rolls BOD+Toughness against the Potency of the agent, the metabolism successfully counters the attack. Gas masks and armor with the “Sealed” Quality offer protection if the agent wasn’t ingested or injected, giving automatic Successes. If the roll fails, the victim must take the results. There could be a general penalty, but there could also be Trauma Damage.",
  "DGNS.AttractantDescription": "An Attractant is always targeted on a specific person or a group of people with identical traits. Their behaviour is influenced to follow the Attractant until they find the source. Mostly, this happens through pheromones that the target finds attractive.",
  "DGNS.NarcoticDescription": "Narcotics cripple the nervous system. As with “Poisoned”, a roll on BOD+Toughness is permitted. Gas masks and the “Sealed” Quality protect against narcotics. In case of a failure, the Damage plus Triggers is subtracted from the enemy’s Ego Points.",
  "DGNS.PseudodesporeingDescription": "The catalytic effect of the spores is blocked for a while, which temporarily lowers a Leperos’s or Psychonaut’s spore infestation by the respective desporeing points. After this time, the target can use its full spore infestation again.<br>This stops a Psychonaut from accessing higher level Phenomenons and reduces the number of dice available to activate Phenomena.",
  "DGNS.RespectedDescription": "The armor is respected by a certain part of the population. Its wearer gets bonus dice on social interactions with this group.",
  "DGNS.FirstImpressionDescription": "The armor impresses. At first contact, its wearer gets bonus dice to all social interactions with strangers.",
  "DGNS.FireResistantDescription": "Fire-resistant armor proves its worth in a Spitfire’s inferno: instead of the normal Armor rating, the rating of the Quality is used. Also, the armor never ignites.",
  "DGNS.ArmorTerrifyingDescription": "Something about the armor awakens a primal fear in those who see it. If their Action roll on PSY+Faith/Willpower (Difficulty) fails, they can only attack the wearer of the armor with a -2D penalty.<br>They can roll before every attack: once the fear is vanquished, they are immune for the rest of the combat. Only the highest source of the Quality is accounted for.",
  "DGNS.ArmorCamoDescription": "Armor with the “Camo” Quality can be hidden from curious eyes. The Quality rating determines the Difficulty to see through the camouflage with a roll on INS+Perception.",
  "DGNS.UnstableDescription": "Riveted iron plates or layers of leather and sheets tied together with wire can be improvised quickly, but every blow weakens them, cuts through cords and tears away plates. If the Damage reaches or surpasses the Quality rating, an Unstable armor loses (1) point of its Armor rating. With 1 kg of scrap (of a level that equals at least Tech Level of the armor) and a roll on AGI+Crafting (Tech Level), (1) point of Armor rating can be recovered.",
  "DGNS.InsulatedDescription": "The material completely protects from electrical discharges. Any electrical Damage is reduced to zero.",
  "DGNS.BulletProofDescription": "Bulletproof armor absorbs the kinetic energy of a projectile fired from a gun, and the wearer takes less Damage: when hit by bullets the Armor rating equals the Quality rating",
  "DGNS.MassiveDescription": "The armor is made from plates or cast in one piece; the material is hard and inflexible. Blades, edges, and pointed weapons are repelled or deflected. The protection against these weapons is higher (Armor rating = Quality rating).<br>On the other hand, Massive armor is susceptible to damage from Blunt weapons. A hammer can dent the material. It changes its shape and applies pressure on organs and bones until they give in and burst or break. Even if such armor is hard to penetrate, the wearer can die from internal injuries.<br>If the Damage (including Triggers) from a Blunt weapons is higher than the normal Armor rating disregarding “Massive”, Flesh Wounds are caused as usual. The Triggers, however, cause additional Trauma.",
  "DGNS.BrittleDescription": "Armor plates can be hardened: it makes their Armor rating rise by (1). However, it also makes the material Brittle. If the armor takes a certain amount of Damage in one hit (determined by the Quality rating), the plates burst and permanently lose (1) point of their Armor rating.<br>The difference from the “Unstable” Quality is that “Brittle” is deliberately accepted when modifying the armor because of the higher Armor rating.",
  "DGNS.SealedDescription": "The armor offers reliable protection from environmental toxins, germs, and spore infestation. When rolling against contamination, the wearer automatically adds Successes.",
  "DGNS.CuttingDescription": "Special ability “Cutting”—If an attack succeeds, the Spitalian can spend (2) Triggers to make the blades snap closed for an additional 1D of Damage. The 2T used are not factored into the Damage calculation, so if the Player rolls only a 1 for the additional Damage, he does (1) point of Damage less than if he had not used “Cutting”. However, in the best case he can do (4) extra points of Damage.",
